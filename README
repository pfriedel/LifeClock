This code drives a 10x11 array of Charlieplexed LEDs using Jimmie Rodger's LoL
Shield Charliplexing code.

The code also talks to a DS1307 RTC over I2C using David Brown's
RealTimeClockDS1307 library.

And because I still had 2 pins free, I'm reading the temperature and humidity
off of a DHT11 using Rob Tillaart's DHT11 library from the Arduino Playground
while getting the temperature off of a DS18B20.

The options mode is from the MixiClock/WiseClock described on the Wise Time
with Arduino blog.

The Life implementation (and general graphics buffer handling) comes from Ben
Brandt's TinyChuck5, just ported up to a much larger display.

fumbling around, it's in a different repository:
