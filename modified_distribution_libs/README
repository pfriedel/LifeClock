This code requires significant fiddling inside of the Arduino distribution to
free up enough RAM to run without crashing.

1) Shrink the I2C twi BUFFER_SIZE from 32 to 8 in the following file:
[Arduino Path]/Resources/Java/libraries/Wire/utility/twi.h 

2) Shrink the I2C Wire BUFFER_LENGTH from 32 to 8 in the following file:
[Arduino Path]/Resources/Java/libraries/Wire/Wire.h

3) Shrink the Hardware Serial buffers from 16 to 4 in the following file:
[Arduino Path]/Resources/Java/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/HardwareSerial.cpp

<   #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 4

>   #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 16

<   #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 4
---
>   #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 64

None of this has an appreciable impact on the running of the LifeBoard binary, but
they might affect other more demanding projects.
